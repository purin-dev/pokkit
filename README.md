**po**cket-te**kkit**

lil game about merging stuff and doing things

mainly to learn phaser + practice more game development

focused on

- decoupling game logic from rendering logic in order to make the game able to simulate itself offline w/ little
  computing power
- ease of adding more content
- having a good time
